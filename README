1. npm init
2. mkdir app/js -p & mkdir dist
3. npm install webpack webpack-dev-server -g --save-dev
4. https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-webpack-plugin
5. npm i babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-react --save-dev
6. create .babelrc file

webpack - compiles code using webpack.config.js file
webpack-dev-server - runs server for rendering of files to clientend. (if you change code - it automatically recompiles
code and renders it on frontend).

Create one index.html file and one app.js file to get them loaded on frontend

**************************/

/*************************/

node install package_name --save-dev (downloads package and put it in node_modules folder so that require package in
code can be resolved from here. You can run binary file of package using node node_modules/package_name/bin/packange_name)

export default component_name helps in importing by simple import abc from component_file_name

To export a single component in ES6, you can use export default as follows:

class MyClass extends Component {
 ...
}

export default MyClass;

And now you use the following syntax to import that module:
import MyClass from './MyClass.react'

If you are looking to export multiple components from a single file the declaration would look something like this:

export class MyClass1 extends Component {
 ...
}

export class MyClass2 extends Component {
 ...
}
And now you can use the following syntax to import those files:
import {MyClass1, MyClass2} from './MyClass.react'

/************************

All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.
Functions which do not attempt to change their inputs, and always return the same result for the same inputs are called
pure functions.

Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps.

An element describes what you want to see on the screen:

const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;
Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects, and are cheap to create.
React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements.

React elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you can't change its children or attributes.
An element is like a single frame in a movie: it represents the UI at a certain point in time.
With our knowledge so far, the only way to update the UI is to create a new element, and pass it to ReactDOM.render().

When you pass props to super, the this the props get assigned to this. Take a look at the following scenario:
constructor(props) {
    super();
    console.log(this.props) //undefined
}

How ever when you do :
constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    console.log(this.props) //props will get logged.
}

/***************************

**Mounting
  These methods are called when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM:
    constructor()
    componentWillMount()
    render()
    componentDidMount()

**Updating
  An update can be caused by changes to props or state. These methods are called when a component is being re-rendered:
    componentWillReceiveProps()
    shouldComponentUpdate()
    componentWillUpdate()
    render()
    componentDidUpdate()

    render() will not be invoked if shouldComponentUpdate() returns false.

**Unmounting
  This method is called when a component is being removed from the DOM:
    componentWillUnmount()

****************************/

/****************************
The constructor for a React component is called before it is mounted.
When implementing the constructor for a React.Component subclass, you should call super(props) before any other
statement. Otherwise, this.props will be undefined in the constructor, which can lead to bugs.

The constructor is the right place to initialize state. If you don't initialize state and you don't bind methods,
you don't need to implement a constructor for your React component.

*****************************/

/****************************

setState(nextState, callback)
Performs a shallow merge of nextState into current state. This is the primary method you use to trigger UI updates from event handlers and server request callbacks.

The first argument can be an object (containing zero or more keys to update) or a function (of state and props) that returns an object containing keys to update.

Here is the simple object usage:

this.setState({mykey: 'my new value'});
It's also possible to pass a function with the signature function(state, props) => newState. This enqueues an atomic update that consults the previous value of state and props before setting any values. For instance, suppose we wanted to increment a value in state by props.step:

this.setState((prevState, props) => {
  return {myInteger: prevState.myInteger + props.step};
});
The second parameter is an optional callback function that will be executed once setState is completed and the component is re-rendered. Generally we recommend using componentDidUpdate() for such logic instead.
